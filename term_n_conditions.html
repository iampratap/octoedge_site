                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you would like to see the resulting maps/models and share them with people you have selected using OCTOEDGE, we need the rights to transmit, display and distribute your User Content.</span></li>
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To test, modify, enhance and improve the Sites, and/or for diagnostic purposes, whether requested by you or not.</span></li>
